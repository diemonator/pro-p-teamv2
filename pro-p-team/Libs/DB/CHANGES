2.0.3
- Fixed the error being thrown when executing JavaScript queries on MySQL X Protocol connections that involve the use of the
  "mysqlx" module, because the module "mysqlx" for JavaScript cannot be imported. (MySql Bug #81052, Oracle bug #23091964).
- Improved the handling of errors, warnings and execution stats output of MySQL X DevAPI statements, all messages are properly
  handled and displayed after batch or console execution.
- Added a new “MySQL Output” pane to display MySQL X DevAPI execution results information, like execution success and times.
- Added "Console Mode" support for JavaScript and Python script editors.  In this mode query execution mimics the way the
  MySQL Shell works, meaning MySQL X DevAPI statements are executed after hitting <ENTER> and results are displayed inline.
- Added a new “MySQL Connections Manager” that enables the sharing of stored MySQL connections with MySQL Workbench if
  It’s installed. MySQL connections are displayed in a friendly way and can be created and edited from within the 
  “MySQL Connections Manager” dialog, and these can be imported to Visual Studio’s Server Explorer to be used in Visual Studio.
- Added SSL support for MySQL connections that use the MySQL X Protocol. SSL support works with PEM files, so SSL connections
  need to be created through the “MySQL Connections Manager” or MySQL Workbench.  Please refer to the official documentation
  for more information.
- Added support for new MySQL X DevAPI functions: parseUri(), isOpen().

  after the user create a MySql Connection checking the option "Always use this selection" when selecting 
  the Data Source and Data Provider (MySql Bug #77441, Oracle bug #22122881)
- Fixed the bug that was preventing to "Generate Database from Model" in an existing "edmx" model,
  caused by an invalid path to the Connector/NET assembly in the MySQL T4 templates files 
  (MySql Bug #74388, Oracle bug #20234532).
- Fixed the error being thrown when working with an empty "edmx" model and attempt to generate a database
  from model, due an invalid data in the MySQL "ttinclude" file (Oracle bug #18181649).
- Create a powershell scripts to handle the uninstall/upgrade issue present in any M4VS plugin versions 
  prior to 1.2.5, when having installed VS2012, or VS2013 or VS2015 and the M4VS plugin < 1.2.5, and then
  uninstall VS first, so when trying to uninstall the M4VS the uninstall/upgrade process was being rolled-back.
- Fixed the M4VS plugin version shown in the "Extensions and Updates" Visual Studio menu to reflect the latest
  released version (Oracle bug #22114385).


1.2.5

  version, and then uninstall Visual Studio first, the M4VS plugin couldn't be uninstalled or upgraded
  (MySQL Bug #71226, Oracle Bug #21953055).
- Remove the "Project Templates" option from the plugin toolbar button and from the "File -> New -> Project" menu, 
  in order to add the "Item Templates" feature with two options: MySQL MVC Item and MySQL Windows Forms Item, 
  available as a context menu for existing projects, which will add a new windows forms or MVC controllers/views 
  connected to MySQL. There is a known issue with item templates not working correctly with MySQL Server 5.7.x,
  avoiding the user to create the entity framework model.
- Added the "Entity Framework" option to the MySQL Website Configuration Dialog, for web projects, so Entity Framework
  version 5 or 6 can be used with a MySQL database provider, automatically adding the configuration/references needed
  to the web.config file and the project itself.
- Fixed the bug where the dataset designer wizard was not showing the stored procedure parameters when creating a 
  "TableAdapter" using existing stored procedures for the "Select" command. Also, fixed the bug where the stored procedure
