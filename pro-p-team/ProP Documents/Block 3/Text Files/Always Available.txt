Always possible
The organisation made a deal with PayPal.
At certain moments PayPal will deliver a logfile (a textfile) to the organisation of the event with
information about the deposits during the last period of time.
PayPal will place terminals on the terrain, so the visitor can transfer money from his/her bank
account to his/her event-account. The software for the terminals will be delivered by PayPal.
It is your task to transfer the information in these text-files to the database. You can see an
example of such a text-file in appendix B.
The organization should always have the possibility to see the status of the system, like:
- What is the current status of a certain visitor?
- The history of a certain visitor (like: did he pay the entrance price; for how much money did
he order food; how much money in total did he transfer to his event-account?)
- How many visitors will visit the event?
- How many visitors are yet visiting the event?
- How many visitors have left the event?
- How much is the total balance of all event-accounts together?
- How much money did they pay in total?
- How much visitors booked a camping spot and for how much money?
- Which camping spots are free?
- For how much money did we sell in a certain shop?
- How many units of a certain article are sold?
